\section{Cut based sensitivity study}
\subsection{Taggetted signal}
The compressed region with 50~\GeV\ or 100~\GeV\ mass splitting.

\subsection{Background}
The considered background including
\begin{itemize}
  \item Di-boson\\
    Same sign $WW$, $WZ$ and $ZZ$ with one or two leptons undetected are inreducible background. $t\bar{t}V$ with one lepton from top quark and the other one from boson. $W+\gamma$ with the photon mis-identified as electron and the other one from $W$ decay.
  \item Charge flip of OS events\\
    Mainly for electrons. The electron has bremsstrahlung inside the detector and the emitted photon coverted to electron-positron pair. The opposite sign lepton is reconstructed thus give a same-sign pair with another lepton.
  \item Jet mis-identified as electron or muon.\\
    The rate for jet to be mis-reconstructed as electron is larger than muon.
\end{itemize}
